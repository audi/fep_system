 1. Definitions
 
      * A License Acknowledgment Certificate ("LAC") is a separate
        document issued by RTI to You specifying the details of the
        licenses that You are granted. You may have multiple LACs. If
        You do not have an LAC, then Your use is as specified under
        "Evaluation License" below.
        
      * A "Project" is a concerted undertaking by an identified
        development team to design or produce a Target Application or
        connected set of Target Applications that has a specified scope
        of functionality, as specified in the LAC.
        
      * A "Project Type" is a collection of restrictions on and/or
        licenses granted to the Project as specified in the LAC.
        
      * A "Site" is a physical location or set of locations, including
        reasonable remote access, as specified in the LAC.
      
      * A "Target Application" is a user-developed software program that
        requires physical incorporation or linking of portions of the
        Software to execute.
      
      * A "User" is a person on the Project team who has used the
        Software for any purpose in the preceding six (6) months,
        including to develop, test, stage, or run a Target Application.
      
      * Development use is developing code that links to and uses the
        Software either directly or through any number of
        internally-developed "wrapper" Application Programmer Interface
        (API) layers. Development includes making copies of the library
        portions of the Software (in subdirectory "/lib") in object code
        form and linking or physically incorporating the copies into a
        Target Application. Development includes any use of the
        Software's programming and analysis tools, XML-based or other
        configuration, or other components of the Software with a
        Graphical User Interface (GUI).
      
      * A "Developer" is a User who does Development.
      
      * A "CPU" is any physical computer processor that has executed a
        Target Application or the Software in the preceding six (6)
        months. In a virtual environment, the number of CPUs is the
        maximum number of simultaneously-loaded images in the preceding
        six (6) months.
      
      * "Internal End Use" is use of the Software in an internal Target
        Application to produce revenue or benefit.
      
      * The "Term" is the active period of this Agreement, as specified
        in the LAC.
 
 2. License
    All licenses are non-transferable and non-exclusive. Use is limited
    to the designated Site and Project, on the Licensed Host(s) or
    Platform(s) as defined in the LAC. For each license, You must pay
    RTI fees in accordance with RTI's then-current, applicable,
    published price list, or as may be specifically agreed to in writing
    between You and RTI.

     a. Developer License
        If You have an LAC that specifies a number of Developer
        Licenses, then up to that number of Users may use the Software
        for Development during the Term.

     b. Internal CPU License
        If You have an LAC that specifies a number of Internal CPU
        licenses, then up to that number of CPUs may execute the
        Software internal to your Project at the Site during the Term.

     c. OEM Runtime CPU License
        If You have an LAC that specifies a number of OEM Runtime CPU
        licenses, then You may physically incorporate copies of the
        Software into a Target Application and distribute Target
        Applications using up to that number of CPUs. Such copies may be
        made only at the Site on the Project. These terms apply to all
        such Target Applications:

         i. Unless your LAC states that you may use an unlimited number
            of OEM Runtime Licenses, You agree to keep records of the
            numbers Target Applications and CPUs you distribute. RTI
            shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to examine
            Your records regarding such practices.
            
        ii. Unless specified in the LAC, Target Applications may not
            contain software development functionality, RTI source code,
            or components of the Software with a Graphical User
            Interface (GUI).
            
       iii. You must distribute Your Target Application to end users
            with a license that acknowledges RTI's copyright, prevents
            further copying of the Software (except for backup
            purposes), and expressly disclaims all warranties by RTI.
            
        iv. RTI offers no warranty to Your end users. THE SOFTWARE, WHEN
            INCORPORATED INTO A TARGET APPLICATION, IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
            AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. RTI DISCLAIMS ALL
            WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE
            WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.
            
         v. Any valid end-user licenses to Target Applications
            incorporating Software granted by You under this Agreement
            shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
            
     d. Source License
        If you have an LAC that specifies a Source License, then You may
        use and modify the source code, and build object versions of the
        original or modified source code.

        If You modify the source code, then You assign and convey all of
        Your copyright to such modifications and derivative works to
        RTI. If for any reason You cannot assign Your copyright, then
        You grant RTI a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, assignable,
        paid-up license to use, copy, modify, distribute, create
        derivative works, sublicense, and otherwise fully utilize the
        modifications without acknowledgment of ownership. You also
        assign or license to RTI any other intellectual property rights
        required to fully use the modifications for any purpose. You
        agree to provide such modifications to RTI upon request. RTI may
        incorporate Your modifications into any future version of the
        Software or into other products at its sole option without fees
        or attribution.

        If You modify the Software, then all warranties are void. Unless
        agreed otherwise, RTI has no obligation to support the modified
        Software.

        A Source License does not grant other rights; a Developer
        License is required for Development, and an Internal CPU or an
        OEM Runtime CPU License is required to create or distribute
        Target Applications.

     e. Evaluation License
        If You have an Evaluation License, or have not received an LAC
        or one of the above licenses from RTI, or are using an
        evaluation or pre-production ("Beta" or "Early Access Release")
        version of the Software, then RTI grants to You a temporary
        license to use the Software for the sole purpose of testing the
        suitability, performance and usefulness of the software for Your
        business needs. You may not use the Software for Development
        (beyond prototypes), or commercial purposes.

        Unless extended by RTI, the Beta or Evaluation period ("Term")
        concludes thirty (30) days from the date of Your first download
        or installation of the Software.

    For all types of licenses, if You elect to use the Software after
    the Term, You will need to acquire an appropriate license. For all
    licenses with a specified numerical limit, You agree to provide RTI
    with good-faith estimates of actual license usage annually. This
    Agreement and the licenses it grants terminate at the end of the
    Term. You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software
    strictly for backup or archival purposes.

 3. Additional Restrictions.
 
     a. Except as provided herein, You may not market, distribute or
        transfer copies of the Software to others. You may not rent,
        lease, loan or otherwise provide the Software to any third parties.
     
     b. You may not use the Software if You are a direct competitor or
        acting on behalf of a direct competitor of RTI, except with
        RTI's prior written consent.  You may not use the Software for
        competitive purposes such as evaluating performance or
        functionality without RTI's prior written consent.
 
 4. Limited Warranty.
 
     a. Research and Nonprofit Licenses and Research and Nonprofit
        Project Types (as defined in the LAC), Evaluation Licenses, and
        OEM Runtime CPU Licenses are provided "as is" with no warranty
        whatsoever. The warranties in this section apply only to paid
        licenses for fully-released versions of the Software at the Site.
     
     b. RTI warrants that the Software will perform substantially in
        accordance with the accompanying written materials for an
        installation period of ninety (90) days from the date that the
        Software is first downloaded by You. RTI does not warrant that
        the Software will meet Your requirements or operate free from
        error. This limited warranty gives You specific legal rights.
        You may have others, which vary from state to state. After the
        installation warranty period, you may elect to purchase support
        or maintenance subject to RTI's policies then in effect see:
        http://www.rti.com/downloads/support-policy.html and
        http://www.rti.com/downloads/maintenance-policy.html.
     
     c. RTI warrants that, other than documented license management
        technology, the Software as well as any medium used to provide
        the Software will be free of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time
        bombs, back or trap doors, or other debilitating or disabling
        devices or malicious code.
     
     d. RTI warrants that the Software is subject to no restrictions or
        licenses that would require You to redistribute any of Your
        source code.
     
     e. RTI warrants that it has the right to grant You the licenses herein.
     
     f. RTI's entire liability and Your sole and exclusive remedy for
        any breach of the foregoing warranty shall be, at RTI's option,
        to either: (i) return the price paid for the Software; or (ii)
        repair or replace the Software. Any replacement Software will be
        warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or
        thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.
     
     g. RTI DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE
        GIVEN BY RTI, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES
        SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS
        WARRANTY AND YOU MAY NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.

 5. Infringement Indemnity. RTI will defend any suit brought against You
    and will pay all damages finally awarded in such suit insofar as
    such suit is based on a claim that the Software as provided to You
    infringes a third-party, provided that RTI is notified promptly of
    such claim and at its expense is given full and complete authority
    (including settlement authority), information and assistance by You
    for such defense. In the event that the Software is held in any such
    suit to infringe such a right and its use is enjoined, or if in the
    opinion of RTI the Software is likely to become the subject of such
    a claim, RTI at its own election and expense will either: (i)
    procure for You the right to continue using the Software; or (ii)
    modify or replace the Software so that it becomes non-infringing
    while giving equivalent performance. In the event that (i) or (ii)
    above are not, in RTI's sole determination, reasonably practicable,
    then RTI may terminate this Agreement and refund an equitable
    portion of money paid by You in connection with the licenses granted
    hereunder.
    
 6. Limited Liability.
 
     a. RTI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES
        FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, COSTS OF COVER, OR THE
        LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE
        (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE)
        EVEN IF RTI OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     
     b. IN PARTICULAR, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE PART OF A
        SYSTEM USED TO CONTROL EXPENSIVE OR DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT.  RTI
        SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM THE
        OPERATION OF SUCH EQUIPMENT.  You agree to indemnify, defend and
        hold RTI harmless from any claim, lawsuit, legal proceeding,
        settlement or judgment (including without limitation RTI's
        reasonable United States and local attorneys' and expert
        witnesses' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with
        the copying, marketing, performance or other distribution of
        Your Target Applications.
     
     c. THE LIABILITY OF RTI FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THIS
        AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF
        ACTION, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AGGREGATE LICENSE
        FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR $10,000.
     
     d. THE LIMITED WARRANTY, LIMITED REMEDIES AND LIMITED LIABILITY
        SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE
        BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN RTI AND YOU. RTI WOULD NOT BE ABLE
        TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.
 
 7. Open Source
 
     a. Portions of the Software may be derived from works of
        contributors to open source projects (Contributors).
        Contributors disclaim all warranties, express or implied as to
        conditions of title non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
        to purpose. Contributors disclaim all liability for damages,
        including direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages.
        Any such warranties and liability are offered by RTI alone as
        stated and limited in this Agreement.
     
     b. If required by the respective licenses, source code for the
        modified open source works is available by emailing a request to
        "license@rti.com".

 8. Support and Maintenance.
     
     a. RTI shall have no obligation under this Agreement for
        corrections of errors or problems which are due to a breach by
        You of the terms of this Agreement, or which cannot be remedied
        due to the operational characteristics of the computer equipment
        on which the Software is used.
     
     b. Except as may be provided above or in a separate RTI Maintenance
        Agreement between RTI and You, if any, RTI is under no
        obligation to maintain or support the Software supplied to You
        and RTI has no obligation to furnish You with any further
        assistance, documentation or information of any nature.
     
     c. You are solely responsible for the support and maintenance of
        all portions of any Target Applications developed by You.

    cause irreparable harm to RTI. You agree to use reasonable efforts
    not to disclose the Software to any third parties and not to use the
    Software other than for the purposes authorized by this Agreement.
    You also agree that performance, functionality or other competitive
    evaluation results shall not be disclosed to third parties without
    RTI's prior written consent. For the purposes of this Article, Your
    subcontractors under appropriate non-disclosure obligations with
    respect to the Software shall not be considered third parties. This
    confidentiality obligation shall continue after any termination of
    this Agreement.
    
10. Termination. If the Term is designated as "Permanent" in the LAC,
    then this Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated due
    to breach. If the Term is designated "Subscription" in the LAC, then
    this Agreement will terminate on the Expiration Date specified in
    the LAC unless terminated due to breach. In the event of a breach of
    this Agreement by either party, the other party may terminate this
    Agreement if such breach is not cured within 10 days of written
    notice. Upon termination, You agree not to use the Software for any
    purpose whatsoever and (except for reasonable backup archives) to
    destroy the Software and any copies then in Your possession or
    control, and (on request) certify in writing or via e-mail to RTI
    that the Software was destroyed. The remedies specified in this
    Agreement shall be in addition to any other remedies available to RTI.
    
11. Export Control. The Software is subject to United States Export
    Administration and Regulations. Downloading, installing, or using

    California except with regard to its choice of law rules. This
    Agreement and the License Acknowledgment Certificate(s) between RTI
    and You constitute the complete, final and exclusive statement of
    the agreement between RTI and You, which supersede all proposals,
    oral or written, and all other communications between the parties
    relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No terms of Your
    purchase order nor any waiver, alteration or modification of the
    provisions of this Agreement will be valid unless made in writing
    and signed by a corporate officer of RTI. Any controversy or claim
    arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof,
    shall be settled by binding arbitration in Santa Clara County,
    California under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
    Arbitration Association by one arbitrator appointed in accordance
    with said rules.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
    may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of
    competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of this
    arbitration provision. If any provision or provisions of this
    Agreement are determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
    the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
    provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or
    impaired thereby.  RTI may assign this Agreement to an entity
    acquiring essentially all of the RTI's relevant business. You may
    not assign, sub-license, or otherwise transfer this Agreement
    without RTI's prior written consent.
